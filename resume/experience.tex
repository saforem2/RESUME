          \item {Software and hardware development for HaloSat, a miniaturized
                  satellite built with the goal of better understanding the
                  missing baryon problem.}
          \item {Helped to design the event detection logic and was responsible
                  for creating the interface necessary for digitizing and
                  interpreting received signals.}
          \item {Worked with a team to build the telemetry system that handled
                  data transmission between the satellite and ground
                  communications networks.}
          \item {Contributed to the in-flight optimization algorithms aimed at
                  maximizing the incoming X-ray signals (by minimizing
                  background noise) while in operation.}

          \item {Helped to construct a model describing the energy density and
                  self-discharge time of nanoscale capacitors. These results
                  helped to identify flaws in many of the previous models and
                  allowed us to create a new design capable of a significantly
                  longer self-discharge time, and consequently, a much larger
                  maximum energy density.} 
          \item {This work was submitted as a patent (pending) titled "Energy
                  Storage in Quantum Resonators", on which I was designated a
                  co-inventor together with my advisor Alfred H\"ubler.}
