          \item {Carried out interdisciplinary research focused on applying
                  ideas from machine learning and data science to simulations in
                  lattice gauge theory (LGT) and lattice quantumchromodynamics 
                  (LQCD).}
          \item {Used unsupervised learning techniques (PCA, k-means
                  clustering) as an alternative method for learning about the
                  phase transition of the Ising model. By representing
                  equilibrium configurations of the system as two-dimensional
                  greyscale images, I was able to obtain a relationship between
                  the first principal component of the covariance matrix
                  associated with a collection of such images, and the specific
                  heat capacity (the physical quantity used to describe the
                  phase transition).}
          \item {Built and trained a multi-layer convolutional neural network
                  in tensorflow used for classifying configurations of the Ising
                  model by temperature. By studying the classification
                  accuracy as a function of temperature, the existence of a
                  phase transition can be identified by where the network
                  begins to fail (characterized by a sharp spike in the
                  classification error).}
          \item {Currently, I am working on using deep feed-forward neural
                  networks and restricted Boltzmann machines to find ways for  
                  improving the efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations in LQCD.}
